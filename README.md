👋 Hi, I'm @JuanEnamorado
👀 I'm interested in data management and analysis, statistical modelling of epidemiological events, programming and process automation.
🌱 I'm currently honing my skills in data visualization, Front-end web development and statistical inference analysis.
💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects related to my profile and data-driven optimization.
